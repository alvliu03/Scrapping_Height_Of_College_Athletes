# Scrapping_Height_Of_College_Athletes

We will be scrapping the height of student athletes from around 40 different universities, find the average height of all the players, find the names and the heights of the athletes with the 5 tallest and 5 shortest heights for both the men’s and women’s teams, generate a bar graph showing the average height distribution across the 4 different team
categories, and outputting a csv file containing the height for each of the men and women swimming and volleyball team.
